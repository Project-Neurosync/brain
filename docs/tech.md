# NeuroSync Technical Architecture

## Core Infrastructure

### Cloud & Hosting Architecture
- **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**
  - **What:** Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Auto Scaling Groups
  - **Why:** Enterprise-grade security compliance, comprehensive IAM model, and ability to implement true private networking with security groups. AWS provides SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and other compliance frameworks out of the box.

- **Containerization with Docker**
  - **What:** Application components deployed as Docker containers
  - **Why:** Enables consistent deployment across environments, improves scalability, isolates services for better security boundaries, and simplifies dependency management.

- **Kubernetes for Orchestration**
  - **What:** Container orchestration with managed Kubernetes service (EKS)
  - **Why:** Provides automatic failover, load balancing, blue-green deployments, and resource efficiency. Security benefits include network policy enforcement and pod security contexts.

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL (Primary Database)**
  - **What:** Relational database for structured data and transactional workloads
  - **Why:** Enterprise-ready ACID compliance, rich feature set, extensible architecture, and robust security model with row-level security and robust authentication options.

- **Neo4j (Graph Database)**
  - **What:** Native graph database for modeling and querying relationships
  - **Why:** Powers the knowledge graph that connects code, developers, issues, discussions, and documentation. Enables complex relationship qu
  eries that would be inefficient in traditional databases, including path finding, centrality analysis, and contextual recommendations. Critical for understanding how different project components relate to each other.

- **ChromaDB (Vector Database)**
  - **What:** Vector database for ML embeddings and semantic search
  - **Why:** Highly optimized for vector similarity operations, which powers our semantic search and ML intelligence features. Lower latency than general-purpose databases for vector operations.

- **Redis (Cache/Pub-Sub)**
  - **What:** In-memory data structure store used for caching and pub/sub messaging
  - **Why:** Reduces database load, speeds up API responses, supports distributed locks for concurrency control, and enables real-time updates through pub/sub channels.

## Application Architecture

### Backend Services
- **FastAPI (Python)**
  - **What:** Modern API framework for backend services
  - **Why:** Built-in async support provides higher throughput for I/O-bound operations (API calls, database queries), automatic OpenAPI documentation, and native Pydantic validation for strict type safety.

- **Celery (Task Queue)**
  - **What:** Distributed task queue for background processing
  - **Why:** Handles compute-intensive operations asynchronously, provides task prioritization, improves scalability under load, and enables more responsive user experiences.

- **SQLAlchemy (ORM)**
  - **What:** SQL toolkit and ORM for database operations
  - **Why:** Provides a security layer between application code and database with parameterized queries (preventing SQL injection), transaction management, and connection pooling for performance.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js (React Framework)**
  - **What:** Server-side rendering and static site generation for React
  - **Why:** Improved SEO, faster initial page loads, better accessibility, and built-in code splitting. Security benefits include server-side authentication validation and API route protection.

- **TypeScript**
  - **What:** Strongly typed superset of JavaScript
  - **Why:** Catches type errors at compile time rather than runtime, improves IDE tooling for developers, enforces code contracts, and reduces security vulnerabilities from type confusion.

- **TailwindCSS**
  - **What:** Utility-first CSS framework
  - **Why:** Reduces CSS bundle size, eliminates unused styles, provides consistent design system, and improves performance with JIT compilation.

## Security & Authentication

### Authentication System
- **JWT with HTTP-Only Cookies**
  - **What:** JSON Web Tokens stored in HTTP-Only cookies for session management
  - **Why:** Prevents XSS attacks by making tokens inaccessible to client-side JavaScript, while maintaining stateless authentication. Short-lived tokens with refresh token rotation improves security posture.

- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**
  - **What:** Industry standard for third-party authentication
  - **Why:** Eliminates password storage, delegates authentication to trusted providers, enables fine-grained permission scopes, and supports token revocation.

### Security Measures
- **Encryption**
  - **What:** AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
  - **Why:** Industry-leading encryption standards protect against data theft and man-in-the-middle attacks, with no known practical cryptographic vulnerabilities.

- **API Security**
  - **What:** Rate limiting, input validation, CORS policies
  - **Why:** Protects against brute force attacks, prevents injections, and restricts cross-origin requests to trusted domains.

## ML & Data Processing Architecture

### Machine Learning Infrastructure
- **PyTorch & Transformers**
  - **What:** Deep learning framework and transformer architecture
  - **Why:** Powers our code understanding, semantic search, and intelligence features with state-of-the-art language models and optimized tensor operations.

- **Hugging Face Integration**
  - **What:** ML model repository and inference APIs
  - **Why:** Provides access to cutting-edge pre-trained models, reducing time-to-market and infrastructure costs while enabling continuous model improvement.

### Data Processing Pipeline
- **Data Ingestion Services**
  - **What:** Integration-specific ingestion modules (GitHub, Jira, Slack, Confluence)
  - **Why:** Specialized parsers ensure correct handling of different data formats, proper permissions enforcement, and optimized throughput.

- **Vector Embedding Generation**
  - **What:** Distributed processing system for generating embeddings
  - **Why:** Converts raw text/code into vector representations that enable semantic search, clustering, and intelligent recommendations.

## DevOps & Monitoring

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**
  - **What:** Automated testing, linting, and deployment pipeline
  - **Why:** Ensures code quality, runs security scans on every commit, prevents vulnerable code from reaching production, and automates dependency updates.

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus & Grafana**
  - **What:** Monitoring stack for metrics, alerting, and visualization
  - **Why:** Provides real-time visibility into system health, performance bottlenecks, and security anomalies with customizable alerts.

- **Application Logging**
  - **What:** Structured logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - **Why:** Centralized log management enables security anomaly detection, audit trails for compliance, and troubleshooting capabilities.

## Integration Architecture

### OAuth Integration Framework
- **What:** Standardized OAuth connector system for all third-party services
- **Why:** Consistent security model across integrations, centralized token management, automated refresh handling, and separation of authentication from data access.

### Secure Data Transfer
- **What:** Encrypted API communication, batched data processing, incremental synchronization
- **Why:** Minimizes data exposure, optimizes API usage within rate limits, and ensures up-to-date information while respecting service provider constraints.

## Scaling & Performance Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling
- **What:** Stateless services, shared-nothing architecture, distributed processing
- **Why:** Enables linear scaling under load, improves fault tolerance, and allows for efficient resource utilization during peak periods.

### Content Delivery
- **What:** CDN integration, static asset optimization, edge caching
- **Why:** Reduces latency for global users, decreases origin server load, and provides additional DDoS protection at the edge.
