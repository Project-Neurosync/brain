# NeuroSync: AI-Powered Knowledge Management for Developers
## Investor Overview

## The Problem

Software development teams face critical challenges that NeuroSync directly addresses:

1. **Knowledge Fragmentation & Context Loss**: Critical information scattered across GitHub, Jira, Slack, and Confluence, causing 30-40% productivity loss.

2. **Knowledge Silos & Bus Factor Risk**: Key information trapped with individual team members, creating high risk when they leave.

3. **Context Switching & Productivity Drain**: Developers waste 2-3 hours daily navigating between disconnected tools.

4. **Code Comprehension & Maintenance Burden**: Understanding the "why" behind code decisions is difficult, slowing development.

5. **Decision Amnesia & Repeated Mistakes**: Teams forget past decisions and repeatedly make the same errors.
