# 🧠 Project Brain — Technical Architecture

## 🏗️ Overview

Project Brain is a modular, AI-driven platform designed to capture, structure, and serve developer team knowledge across code, tickets, docs, chats, and meetings. The system leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), graph indexing, and integrations with developer tools to deliver project memory as a service.

## 1️⃣ Data Ingestion Layer

Connectors that pull or subscribe to updates from external tools. Modular ETL design.

| Source        | Data Ingested                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GitHub        | PRs, commits, issues, comments            |
| Jira          | Issues, sprints, epics, status changes    |
| Slack/Teams   | Channels, threads, discussions            |
| Confluence    | Docs, change history                      |
| Google Meet   | Transcripts via Whisper / ReadAI / AssemblyAI |
| Zoom/Teams    | Meeting recordings and summaries          |

🛠️ Stack:
- Temporal / Celery / BullMQ for job orchestration
- REST + Webhooks

---

## 2️⃣ Knowledge Graph & Indexing Layer

Organizes all artifacts into a project-wide memory structure with connections and versioning.

| Entity Types  | Examples                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Repo          | repo-auth-service, repo-invoice-service  |
| Feature       | login-refactor, checkout-flow-v2         |
| Meeting       | July 4th Standup, Sprint Planning Week 12|
| Ticket        | JIRA-1243, GH-issue-88                   |

🛠️ Stack:
- Neo4j or TypeDB (graph database)
- PostgreSQL (relational data, metadata)
- Redis (cache layer)

---

## 3️⃣ Embedding & Vector Store Layer

Enables semantic search and RAG-based reasoning over all ingested content.

| Embedded Content           |
|----------------------------|
| PR descriptions + comments |
| Jira ticket summaries      |
| Meeting transcript chunks  |
| Documentation sections     |
| Slack/Teams threads        |

🛠️ Stack:
- Embeddings: OpenAI / Cohere / HuggingFace Transformers
- Vector DB: Pinecone / Weaviate / Qdrant
- Chunking: Token-based windowing with metadata tags

---

## 4️⃣ AI Reasoning & RAG Layer

Retrieves relevant chunks and generates contextual responses with citations.

📦 Components:
- Hybrid retriever: keyword + vector scoring
- Chunk re-ranker (optional)
- RAG response generator (GPT-4o / Claude)
- Source linking: show PR, Jira, or transcript that answer came from

🛠️ Stack:
- LangChain / LlamaIndex (optional)
- Prompt templates & memory management
- Token budgeting per LLM API

---

## 5️⃣ API Layer

Acts as backend for frontend and integrations.

📦 Features:
- REST & GraphQL endpoints
- WebSocket gateway (for real-time updates)
- File upload (for meeting recordings, if needed)

🛠️ Stack:
- FastAPI / NestJS
- Socket.IO or WebSocket layer
- JWT / OAuth2 support

---

## 6️⃣ Frontend Layer

User-facing web app for interacting with the system.

📦 Pages:
- Dashboard (project overview)
- Repo/Module Timeline
- KT Assistant Chat UI
- Decision History + Meeting Archive
- Weekly Digest / Notifications

🛠️ Stack:
- React + TailwindCSS + Next.js
- TanStack Query / React Query
- shadcn/ui components
- Pusher / Socket.IO client

---

## 7️⃣ Auth & Access Control

Secure access based on team roles and integration scopes.

📦 Features:
- GitHub OAuth / SSO login
- Role-based views (Dev, QA, PM)
- Fine-grained permissions per project/repo

🛠️ Stack:

- Firebase Auth / Clerk / Auth0
- RBAC middleware
- Invite system with email domain whitelisting

---

## 8️⃣ Analytics & Monitoring (Optional)

Track usage, performance, and traceability.

📊 Types:
- User activity (searches, KT time)
- Repo usage stats
- Time to onboard new joiners
- Transcription accuracy logs

🛠️ Stack:
- PostHog / Mixpanel (product analytics)
- Prometheus + Grafana (metrics)
- Sentry (error tracking)
- ELK Stack (logging)

---

## ⛓️ High-Level Data Flow

1. Data ingested from tools → chunked + tagged
2. Indexed in:
   - Graph DB (structure)
   - Vector DB (semantic)
3. On user query:
   - Hybrid search → context → LLM
4. Answer + source citations returned to UI
5. Snapshots auto-generated during key transitions
