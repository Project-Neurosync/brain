üéØ COMPLETE NEUROSYNC ROADMAP
Only tick when production-ready and fully tested

üîß CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
 Vector Database Operations (ChromaDB/Pinecone semantic search)
 Knowledge Graph Implementation (Neo4j for relationships)
 ML Data Importance Filter (Timeline-based, relevance scoring)
 Project Management System (Creation, access control, user associations)
 File Upload & Processing (PDF, DOCX, code files, batch processing)
üîó INTEGRATION CONNECTORS
 GitHub Integration (API calls, repo scanning, webhooks, file processing)
 Jira Integration (API calls, ticket ingestion, comments, status tracking)
 Slack Integration (API calls, channel/message ingestion, thread context)
 Confluence Integration (API calls, page ingestion, hierarchy understanding)
üß† ADVANCED AI FEATURES
 Context Persistence (Project memory across sessions)
 Multi-Source Knowledge Synthesis (Connect code + meetings + tickets)
 Code Architecture Understanding (Dependency mapping, pattern recognition)
 Meeting Decision Tracking (Extract and link decisions to code changes)
 Developer Onboarding Flows (Guided project walkthroughs)
‚ö° REAL-TIME & COLLABORATION
 WebSocket Implementation (Real-time updates)
 Live Notifications (Data ingestion, mentions, updates)
 Collaborative Features (Shared project insights)
ü§ñ ML DATA INTELLIGENCE
 Data Importance Scoring (ML model to filter relevant data)
 Timeline-Based Storage (Chronological data organization)
 Duplicate Detection (Avoid redundant information)
 Context Relevance (Score data importance to project context)
üîç SEARCH & DISCOVERY
 Semantic Code Search (Find code by intent, not just keywords)
 Cross-Source Search (Search across code, docs, meetings simultaneously)
 Contextual Suggestions (Proactive insights based on current work)
üí∞ BUSINESS FEATURES
 Payment-First Registration (Razorpay integration complete)
 Token Usage Optimization (Smart model routing)
 Admin Dashboard (User management, analytics)
üöÄ THE VISION: PROJECT BRAIN CAPABILITIES
When complete, NeuroSync will:

Know every line of code and why it was written
Remember every meeting decision and its impact
Understand project evolution through timeline analysis
Guide new developers with contextual onboarding
Predict potential issues based on historical patterns
Connect disparate information across all project sources
üìã IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
Start with Core Infrastructure (Vector DB, ML filtering)
Build One Integration at a Time (GitHub ‚Üí Jira ‚Üí Slack ‚Üí Confluence)
Add AI Intelligence Layer (Context building, synthesis)
Implement Real-time Features (WebSockets, notifications)
Polish and Optimize (Performance, user experience)
This is ambitious but achievable. Each component builds on the previous ones to create the ultimate "Project Brain" that never forgets and always understands context.

Ready to start with the first component? I suggest we begin with Vector Database Operations since that's the foundation for everything else.
